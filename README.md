    canal := usercanal.NewClient("YOUR_API_KEY")
    defer canal.Close()

    // Track a simple event
    ctx := context.Background()
    canal.Track(ctx, usercanal.Event{
        UserId: "123",
        Name:   usercanal.FeatureUsed,
        Properties: usercanal.Properties{
            "feature_name": "export",
